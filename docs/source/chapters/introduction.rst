Introduction
==============

Rising competition and sluggish growth at home are forcing more and more businesses to consider exporting or, if already active at an international level, to diversify into new products and/or markets.
Most export strategies revolve around the issues of:
•	Which regions/countries are worth pursuing and spending money on?
•	How should the available product range be tailored so as to take advantage of the opportunities present in the market(s)?
•	Which export opportunities should we focus our attention on, given the constraints of time, money, manpower and/or expertise?
Achieving international success is rarely a simple process. International trade policymakers and practitioners alike are faced with a great deal of uncertainty, which makes strategic planning challenging. Both are preoccupied with how to allocate their resources wisely and how to design export marketing initiatives that stand the greatest chance of delivering long-term value. Ideally, such decisions should be based on fact-rich intelligence derived from academically rigorous and scientific research methods, but they should also reflect real-world pragmatism.


What are typical questions asked by those with an international portfolio?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
“My client wants to know which markets in Africa hold the most realistic opportunities for motor vehicle tyre exports. How should I go about sourcing such information?”
“Our CEO is visiting India next month. How should he structure his visits to government and private concerns so that he comes away with an understanding of the most important industries and demand patterns in the country?”
“Our company wants to expand its existing product range and diversify into new market regions. Which products and markets would be realistic candidates for in-depth market analysis?”
“Our department needs to coordinate an international trade mission aimed at both existing and potential exporters in our country. Whom should we approach and what product categories should we focus on?”
“We wish to optimise our company’s operations in various export markets. What are the key factors to consider when deciding which new offices to open and which of the current ones to overhaul? “


Why is it difficult to choose viable export markets?
----------------------------------------------------
The complexity and ever-changing nature of the international trade environment have given rise to multiple research reports, analyses and commentaries, and it is easy to feel overwhelmed in the face of such ‘information overload’. How is it possible, many people ask, to assess all the data and information on offer in order to compare markets in terms of:
•	country risk,
•	logistics costs,
•	trade barriers, and
•	size and growth potential?
Few businesses have the time or resources to devote to comprehensive market studies. Not surprisingly, market selection is often a hit-or-miss affair, with the resulting export returns being disappointing.
4.	What if data could be distilled into meaningful intelligence?
TRADE, a specialist research entity at the North-West University in South Africa, is helping organisations to streamline their market selection decisions and focus their export efforts. Using a scientifically sound methodology that systematically scans and screens international trade and market data, TRADE in collaboration with TRADE Research Advisory (PTY) , has developed the TRADE-DSM Navigator™, a tool designed to identify pre-qualified, realistic export opportunities:
What if data could be distilled into meaningful intelligence – at the click of a button? Introducing the TRADE-DSM Navigator™
•	per HS-6 product level (or other classification system, e.g. SIC)
•	per individual product sector
•	per industry sector (e.g. agro-industry)
•	per potential export market (e.g. the Netherlands)
•	per potential export region (e.g. Africa or SADC)
The methodology has application for active and aspiring exporters, as well as trade promotion officials operating at national and provincial level.
