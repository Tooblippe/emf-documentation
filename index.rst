   <h3>What is Export Market Finder?</h3>

.. ..Next section = Standard

Trade Advisory's **Export Market Finder** is an export decision-making application that assists with the identification of products and markets with realistic shorter-term ‘untapped’ export potential as well as opportunities for export market diversification.

With data for >180 markets (countries) and >5,000 products (tariff codes, defined by the |location_WCO| it provides detailed and practical information for trade professionals, officials, advisors and policymakers around the world.

.. note::
   A realistic export opportunity consists at the minimum of a single product (HS6 tariff line code) x market (country) combination.
   The evaluation and charcterisation of such a realistic export opportunity is based on a highly structured,
   scientifically based and repeatable framework referred to as the TRADE-DSM® methodology.

The TRADE-DSM® methodology (Decision Support Model) was developed in association with the TRADE research focus area and is a registered trademark of |location_NWU_Trade|, North-West University, South Africa.
