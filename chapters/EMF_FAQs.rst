Development and data related

Who developed Export Market Finder?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|FAQ_Who_Developed|

The TRADE-DSM® methodology (Decision Support Model) was developed by the TRADE research focus area and is a registered trademark of |location_NWU_Trade|, North-West University, South Africa.
Since 2016 |location_Trade_Advisory| has continued to expand the application and background research in association with the TRADE research focus area
located at the North-West University, South Africa.

See :ref:`RST Reading list` for some research papers and sources for the underlying methodology.

    How does TIQ Market Finder Compare with ITC Trade Map (Austrade Tool)?
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #) The ITC platform provides a quick view of untapped potential in graph format,
       but no support to actually compile a user friendly explanatory report or presentation that can assist
       with explanation of the nuances of the identified potential in a productive (click of the button) way
       – such as Export Market Finder.
    #) The ITC platform does not support explaining why one would NOT recommend a particular market
       – the detailed of how ITC reaches the outcome for a specific market is not accessible as with Market Finder.
    #) On a more technical note, ITC does not consider trade logistics at all whereas Market Finder is constructed
       specifically from Brisbane harbour to the world.
    #) ITC methodology ‘caps’ potential based on the home market (Australia’s) historic trade and production
       – whereas Market Finder allows for this constraint to be relaxed in finding new potential
       (for less mature export products by market).
    #) ITC does not have ‘in-person’ support available to answer questions.
    #) ITC does not present the information in a format that the Client Officer can easily understand and
       augment and then present to the Client. Market Finder focuses on this and allows for depth and personalisation
       – the ITC is designed to support Exporters who are either at the Start stage or at the very first part of
       exploring their options around market diversification.
    #) Through the be-spoke data model developed between TIQ and Trade Advisory;
       Export Market Finder provides Queensland (state) level data
       – this is not available within the Austrade (ITC) model, which provides Country level data only.
    #) Both tools use the same macro level annual data (based on World Customs Organisation Harmonised System (HS) classification,
       reported by the United Nations COMTRADE data set) so both tools have the same issue around time lag
       (generally around 18 months). The difference for the Market Finder tool is that it seeks to support a
       forward view around strategizing for Export Market Growth – it takes the data and seeks to provide a forward view;
       recognising it is not in the business of making predictions (sadly it doesn’t do Lotto numbers either);
    #) The Market Finder tool provides a focus on Realistic Export Opportunities through clearly defined filters and
       values which helps provide depth and nuance to the product/ market itself;
    #) The Market Finder tool is being develop to provide a product – multiple market view for example Australia
       – Queensland Avocados to a series of Markets as opposed to the USA as an individual market.
       This is not a functionality supported by the Austrade – ITC model and;
    #) The Market Finder tool has two-tiers to it: Accompanying these slides is the snap-shot report which is primarily
       targeted to supporting our Client Managers and providing a short, sharp – operational level of analysis to
       support direct Client engagement. Alongside this tool is the more detailed (and complex) database that
       allows TIQ to provide a more strategic view; be it Market and/ or industry/ sector based.
       This is a level of depth not supported by the ITC model as provided on the Austrade web-site.
